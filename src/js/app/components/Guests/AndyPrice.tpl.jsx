                        <p><em>Comic Artist</em></p>
                        <p>Andy Price is a comic book artist from the USA. He is involved with IDW Publishing’s adaption of “My little Pony: Friendship is Magic” since issue 1. This release was so highly anticipated, that it was the first comic book that broke the 100.000 copies pre-order records of a comic not published by DC or Marvel since almost one decade.</p>
                        <p>Price has done illustration work for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Innovation Comics, and the Rittenhouse Archives. His other comics work includes licensed titles based on the television series Quantum Leap and WordGirl. Price is a graduate of Austin High School in Decatur, Alabama, and the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art. He currently resides in Madison, Alabama, with his wife, Alice.</p>
