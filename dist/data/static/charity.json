    "<p>Living forever seems unlikely even with today’s advanced technology or alicorn magic. Neither, it is said, can we take anything with us when we go – no wealth, no training, no knowledge. But one thing remains: our legacy. Our legacy is forever.</p>",
    "<p>To live forever, some aim to be remembered. Others create works that outlive them, like Shakespeare or Beethoven, whose legacy may remain even when their names are forgotten. Few succeed. We are no experts in either of these arts.</p>",
    "<p>Our art is that of creating positive change that outlives us.All three auctions at GalaCon – the Silent Auction, the Super Speedy Saturday Sale, and the Grand Auction on Sunday – will benefit Animal Equality, and you can also donate to Animal Equality at our Bronies for Good table.</p>",
    "<p>Animal Equality will use these funds to document, publicize, and hopefully end the pervasive abuses of animals in factory farms around the world, an industry that is also responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the whole transportation sector.</p>",
    "<p>Are you also one who wants to be not remembered but felt? Felt by those who would not be alive had it not been for you? Felt by those who would suffer had it not been for you? Then join us this GalaCon 2018 to get to work on your legacy. Let us all make our contribution to forestalling runaway global warming and preventing the suffering of billions of animals.</p>"
